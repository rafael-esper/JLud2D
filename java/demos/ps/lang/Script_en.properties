# Cinematic Display: Intro
Cinematic_Intro_1 = Citizens of Camineet, this boy\u2019s corpse is a reminder for all of you.
Cinematic_Intro_2 = Defiance of Lord LaShiec will not be tolerated!
Cinematic_Intro_3 = Nero? NERO! What happened?!
Cinematic_Intro_4 = Alisa. My sister. Listen closely, I don\u2019t have long. LaShiec is a threat to all of Algol, he can not remain in power. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to him, but I do know this. Lord LaShiec must die. For the sake of everyone, Alisa, you have to kill him. My mistake was trying to take him on alone. These are dangerous people, you\u2019re going to need help.
Cinematic_Intro_5 = I\u2019ve heard tales of a warrior, a man named Tylon, who shares my cause. I wanted to enlist his help, but he\u2019s gone missing. You have to find him, Alisa. Find Tylon, and kill LaShiec, before it\u2019s too late. Alisa...such a terrible burden. I\u2019m so sorry. Please forgive me, for asking this of you... ...and for leaving you all... alone...
Cinematic_Intro_6 = Nero... I know that you wouldn\u2019t ask this of me if there was any other way. Your death will not be meaningless, I swear it. Watch over and protect me, big brother. I\u2019m off to kill the most powerful man in the world.

# Camineet
Camineet_House_Alis = This is Alisa's home. Nero's presence can still be felt here.
Camineet_House_Nekise_intro = My name is Nekiseh. I'm sorry to hear about your brother. Last we heard, Tylon was staying in a town called Shion. Nero asked me to hold on to this Laconian Pot. He would have wanted you to have this. Here, take it.
Camineet_House_Nekise_greet = I'm sorry, I can't risk helping you any more. Good luck.
Camineet_House_Man = You'll need a Dungeon Key if you want to open locked doors.
Camineet_House_Suelo_intro1 = You're doing what?
Camineet_House_Suelo_intro2 = Alisa...taking on LaShiec is crazy, but I know how stubborn you are, so I'll do what I can to help.
Camineet_House_Suelo_intro3 = If you get hurt, come back here and your old pal Suelo will fix you up.
Camineet_House_Suelo_greet = Please get some rest. Don\u2019t overdo it, okay? You will always be welcome here.
Camineet_House_Oldman = Do you know about the planets of Algol?
Camineet_House_Oldman_Yes = Oh. Okay.
Camineet_House_Oldman_No = There are three planets: Palma, Motavia, and Dezoris. The three planets have a distinct geology. Palma is a planet of greenery. Motavia is a planet of sand. Dezoris is a planet of ice.
Camineet_House_Oldman_NoCrisis = To tell you the truth, I fear for the future of our planets.
Camineet_People_Ent1 = Some dungeons are pitch black, you'll need a light.
Camineet_People_Ent2 = I can't believe the spaceport requires a Roadpass now. How am I supposed to get home?
Camineet_People_Ent3 = I've heard that illegal goods are traded in port towns.
Camineet_People_Ent4 = How long are they going to hold us under martial law like this?
Camineet_People_Cop1 = Unless you have a death wish, you should remain inside.
Camineet_People_Cop2 = Citizens are advised to remain inside the residential area.
Camineet_People_Cop_No_Pass = Sorry, we're on high security alert. A signed Roadpass is required to access the spaceport. Access denied.
Camineet_People_Cop_Pass = Access granted. Go on through.

# Parolit
Parolit_House_1 = Welcome to Parolit residential district.
Parolit_House_2 = It's easy to get lost in the forest, be careful.
Parolit_House_3 = I've heard that a monster called Medusa was awakened in the cave south of here. Rumor has it she turns all who look at her into stone!
Parolit_People_Ent1 = You can get to Paseo on planet Motavia from the spaceport. But due to heightened security, you'll need a Roadpass.
Parolit_People_Ent2 = Did you know there's an abandoned catacomb leading west, to the Gothic Woods? Supposedly it's somewhere nearby, but I can't find it.
Parolit_People_Ent3 = If you go east, you\u2019ll come to a port town called Shion.
Parolit_People_Cop1 = Unless you have a death wish, you should remain inside.
Parolit_People_Cop2 = Citizens are advised to remain inside the residential area.
Parolit_People_Cop_No_Pass = Sorry, we're on high security alert. A signed Roadpass is required to access the spaceport. Access denied.
Parolit_People_Cop_Pass = Access granted. Go on through.

# Scion
Scion_House_1 = If you head north, you'll find a knoll called Baya Marlay, but you won\u2019t be able to get to it.
Scion_House_2 = The only way to open a door sealed with magic is to cast a spell of your own.
Scion_House_3 = There are intelligent aliens on Motavia and Dezoris. Life on another planet! Can you imagine it?
Scion_House_4_PreMyau = Yeah, Tylon was here. He said something about going south, to slay Medusa. He had a strange, talking animal with him! It had a bottle of medicine around its neck. I wonder what it was?
Scion_House_4_AfterMyau = It's about time someone took on LaShiec. God be with you.
Scion_House_5 = You'd have to be some kind of idiot to go into Eppi Forest without a Compass.
Scion_House_6_PreMyau = This is going to sound crazy, but I found a talking animal wandering Medusa's dungeon. I sold it to a trader in Paseo. The little guy was worth a fortune!
Scion_House_6_AfterMyau = The economy's plummeted since LaShiec came into power. I'm so broke, I don't know what to do...
Scion_House_7 = Iala Cave lies on the peninsula south of town.
Scion_People_Ent1 = Welcome to Shion. We had a bustling trade economy here, until LaShiec's embargo. Now most of us are desperate for work.
Scion_People_Ent2 = I used to go spelunking in Naula cave, on the coast north of Baya Marlay. But with all these monsters suddenly appearing, I wouldn't even try to get there now.
Scion_Second_Hand_Shop_Secret1 = I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I run a legitimate business here.
Scion_Second_Hand_Shop_Secret2 = I already told you once, I don't deal with illegal goods. Get out of my store.
Scion_Second_Hand_Shop_Secret3 = You're not going to give up, are you? Here, just take it. One Roadpass, signed and certified. If anyone asks you about two dead couriers, deny everything.

# Spaceport
Spaceport_People_Ent1 = Welcome to Palma's Spaceport. You can travel to Paseo on Motavia from here.
Spaceport_People_Ent2 = These ships are headed toward Paseo, the capital of Motavia. The Governor-general lives there.
Spaceport_People_Ent3 = Before space travel was commercialized, spaceships were built at a research laboratory in Gothic.
Spaceport_People_Cop = Do you have a passport?
Spaceport_People_Cop_YesLie = Don't be a fool!
Spaceport_People_Cop_Yes = You may proceed.
Spaceport_People_Cop_No = You may not pass.
Spaceport_Passport_Intro = Are you here to apply for a Passport?
Spaceport_Passport_No = Very well. Next in line, please?
Spaceport_Passport_Yes = I'm required by law to ask you a series of questions. Have you ever been convicted of a crime?
Spaceport_Passport_IllegalYes = I'm sorry, you don't qualify. Next?
Spaceport_Passport_IllegalNo = Do you suffer from an illness that may be irritated by travel?
Spaceport_Passport_IllnessNo = There is a handling fee of 100 mesetas. Can you pay?
Spaceport_Passport_IllnessYes = I'm sorry, you don't qualify. Next?
Spaceport_Passport_PayNo = Very well. Next in line, please?
Spaceport_Passport_PayYes = Okay then, I'll issue you a passport. Here you are. Next in line!
Spaceport_Passport_PayNoMesetas = You don't have enough money. Come back later.
Spaceport_Shuttle = This is a non-stop flight to Motavia. Getting on?

Spaceport_People_Cop_Closed = Access denied. Space travel is now entirely off limits to all citizens. This is a matter of national security.
Spaceport_People_Cop_TakePassport = We'll be confiscating your passport now.


# Paseo Spaceport
Paseo_Spaceport_Ent1 = This is Paseo Spaceport, the only spaceport on Motavia.
Paseo_Spaceport_Ent2 = It's ant-lion breeding season, be careful out there.
Paseo_Spaceport_Ent3 = I hear there's a cake shop in Naula cave on Palma. I wonder if it gets any business, in a cave like that?
Paseo_Spaceport_Shuttle = This shuttle is heading for Palma. Getting on?

# Paseo
Paseo_House_1 = This is Paseo, Motavia\u2019s capital city.
Paseo_House_2 = You can't cross over ant-lions on foot.
Paseo_House_3 = The Governor-General loves sweets.
Paseo_People_Ent1 = The cave Mahal is located in the mountains north of Paseo.
Paseo_People_Ent2 = There are intelligent monsters, but they speak a different language than ours. You'd have to be some kind of magician to understand them.
Paseo_People_Ent3 = To meet with the Governor-General, you need to present a gift.
Paseo_People_Ent4 = Even the Governor-general is on bad terms with LaShiec.
Paseo_People_Cop_Exit = You had better not leave the residential area.
Paseo_People_Cop_Passage = zzz...
Paseo_Shop_Myau = Ever seen a talking cat before? Rare. Real rare. One of a kind if I'm not mistaken. One million mesetas, and it's yours. How 'bout it?
Paseo_Shop_MyauYes = You don't have enough mesetas!
Paseo_Shop_MyauNo = That's too bad. ...hold on, now. Is that a Laconian Pot? How 'bout a trade, the pot for the kitty?
Paseo_Shop_MyauTradeYes = I hate to see the little guy go, but I can't pass up a trade like this. Take good care of 'im.
Paseo_Shop_MyauTradeNo = Whoa, seriously? Hey, where are you going?
Paseo_Shop_MyauAfter = I made a fortune selling that Laconian Pot! Thanks!
Paseo_People_Cop_No_Pass = Sorry, we're on high security alert. A signed Roadpass is required to access the spaceport. Access denied.
Paseo_People_Cop_Pass = Access granted. Go on through.

Paseo_Passageway_Cop = Halt! Did you bring a gift for the Governor-general?
Paseo_Passageway_Cop_NoGiftYes = These are not suitable gifts!
Paseo_Passageway_Cop_NoGiftNo = I can't grant you access without a gift!
Paseo_Passageway_Cop_Gift = Ah, Shortcake. He'll be pleased. I'll hold on to this for you. Proceed.
Paseo_Governor_RestHouseBefore = You look tired, why don't you rest here for a while?
Paseo_Governor_RestHouseAfter = Good luck out there. You're going to need it.
Paseo_Governor_Intro = You plan to overthrow LaShiec, do you not? LaShiec is a powerful man. No, more than a man. He's beyond those constraints. He's something else entirely. You're very brave to take him on. But bravery, I fear, will not be enough. However, there's something inside you, something very powerful. It is a power that you must discover on your own. I can tell you no more. Not yet. Go. Destroy him. I won't stop you. In fact, I will offer you assistance. A powerful Esper named Lutz lives in Mahal cave, north of here. Take this letter to him. He will understand. Return here when you have defeated LaShiec. I have faith in you.
Paseo_Governor_Rest = You must be tired from your journey. Why don\u2019t you rest here for a while?
Paseo_Governor_Dream = You fell into a deep sleep...
Paseo_Governor_BadDream = It was all a dream...
Paseo_Governor_Return = There is not a single moment to lose. Please be careful. I pray for your safety.
Paseo_Governor_Greet = Return here when you have defeated LaShiec. God be with you.
Paseo_Governor_Greet_BeforeLutz = Since the orders are from the Governor-general, Lutz will probably listen.


# Paseo/End
Paseo_Mansion_Darkfalz = Empty! Where is the Governor-General?
Paseo_Governor_Darkfalz_Dead = Hey there. Are you dead? What a pity. Revive and try again.
Paseo_Governor_Darkfalz = Oh, goodness. My mind and body were...taken over, by an evil force. It's a wonder I'm still alive. Thank you. You've done it. You've saved Algol. History shall repeat your names, always.
Paseo_Governor_End = Alisa. There's something I must tell you. It's a secret I've kept from you, to spare your life. Now that LaShiec is gone, it's safe to come out with it. Alisa...your father was the king of Algol. His royal blood is inside you. It has given you strength. We are without a leader, Alisa. Will you succeed your father and become Algol\u2019s queen?
Paseo_Governor_EndYes = Good! You are now Queen of Algol.
Paseo_Governor_EndNo = No? That's fine, if you so desire. You will always be welcome here.
Paseo_Governor_EndOk = Your father was the best king Algol has ever known. And more than that, he was a good man. He would be proud of you today.


# Cinematic Display: Myau
Cinematic_Myau_1 = I guess we\u2019re companions now, huh? I\u2019m Alisa. What\u2019s your name?
Cinematic_Myau_2 = Myau.
Cinematic_Myau_3 = Hello, Myau. I\u2019m looking for a man named Tylon. Rumor has it he was traveling with a talking animal. I don\u2019t suppose that was you?
Cinematic_Myau_4 = Tylon got turned to stone trying to slay Medusa! We can heal him with this medicine, but I can\u2019t open the lid. He should still be in the cave south of Camineet, do you know how to get there?
Cinematic_Myau_5 = I think I can manage. Come on, let\u2019s go help him.

# Odin in Stone
Odin_Stone = It looks like this person\u2019s been turned to stone. Could this be Tylon?
Odin_Item_Alsulin = Alisa opened the lid to the bottle and poured out its contents.
Odin_Item_Myau = But Myau couldn\u2019t open the lid to the bottle.

# Cinematic Display: Odin
Cinematic_Odin_1 = Ah, Myau, you found help. Thank you. Medusa was stronger than I thought, I don\u2019t stand a chance of defeating LaShiec. Who\u2019s your new friend?
Cinematic_Odin_2 = My name is Alisa. My brother Nero was murdered trying to overthrow LaShiec. I\u2019m going to kill him. Nero gave me your name just before he died. He said that you\u2019d help.
Cinematic_Odin_3 = I see. Well, I can\u2019t let a girl like you go alone, now can I?
Cinematic_Odin_4 = I appreciate your concern, but I can hold my own, thank you. Why did you go after Medusa?
Cinematic_Odin_5 = Medusa has a legendary axe, I was hoping to see LaShiec\u2019s blood on it. I hid a Compass at a dead end inside this cave. We\u2019re going to need it. Let\u2019s go.

# Eppi
Eppi_People_Ent1 = Welcome to Eppi Village! We don't get many visitors lately, now that the forest is crawling with monsters.
Eppi_House_1 = It wouldn't surprise me if the Governor-general of Motavia approved of what you're doing.
Eppi_House_2 = All the great Espers live on Motavia.
Eppi_House_3 = Do you know what the hardest, strongest material in the world is?
Eppi_House_3_Yes = O.K. Good day.
Eppi_House_3_No = It's Laconia! Laconian weapons are the strongest around!
Eppi_House_4 = Long ago, a professor named Luveno had a research laboratory in the Gothic Woods. I wonder if it's still there?
Eppi_House_Key = Taking on ol' LaShiec, are you? You're either a fool, or you're tougher than you look. Either way, I admire your bravery. Are you in need of a Dungeon Key?
Eppi_House_KeyNo = Good luck.
Eppi_House_KeyYes = I hid one inside the warehouse on the outskirts of Camineet's residential district. It's all yours.
Eppi_House_Key_Return = You're going to need all the help you find to defeat Lashiec.

# Naula Cave
Naula_CakeShop = Hey, welcome, glad you could make it. Sorry about the location. With all these tax hikes, it's all I could afford. You know how it is. My world famous shortcakes are 280 mesetas. Would you like one?
Naula_CakeShopNo = Well, come again.
Naula_CakeShopYes = Thanks! Come again!

# Iala Cave
Iala_Man = I've seen plenty of men go into the inner chamber. Coming out, though, is a different story. I've never seen anyone come out of there alive.

# Maharu Cave
Maharu_Noah_NoLetter = Who are you? I'm trying to train. Don't interrupt me.

Cinematic_Noah_1 = You must be Lutz. I have a letter for you from the Governor-general. Would you mind reading it?
Cinematic_Noah_2 = Let me see that. ...Ah. I see. So it\u2019s come to this. I apologize for my earlier hostility. LaShiec is a dangerous man. For the sake of Algol, he must be stopped. I think I can help. We have to alert Dr. Luveno, in the Gothic woods. If I recall, we can get there through a manhole at Camineet Space Station. Let\u2019s go. Quickly.

# Manhole Passage
Spaceport_Passage_Assistant = Don't distract me! I'm very busy.
Spaceport_Passage_Assistant_pos_Luveno = What? You busted out Doc? What?! He's building you a spaceship?! He's too old for this. I'd better go help him out.

# Gothic
Gothic_People_Ent1 = I could really use a PelorieMate. Can you spare one?
Gothic_People_Ent1No = Then I ain't helping. Get lost.
Gothic_People_Ent1Yes = Thanks. I suppose you're looking for Doc Luveno. Yeah, his lab used to be here. Not no more, though. They finally locked that loon up. He's being held in Triada, a prison south of here.
Gothic_People_EntNotEnoughCola = Do I look like an idiot?!
Gothic_People_Ent2 = I could really use a PelorieMate. Can you spare one?
Gothic_People_Ent2No = Then I ain't helping. Get lost.
Gothic_People_Ent2Yes = Thank you, stranger. At the end of the path leading into the mountains is an ancient tower. Word on the street is ol' Medusa is hiding out there. Unless you fancy being a statue, you best stay away.
Gothic_People_Ent3 = Hey! Keep outta my turf!
Gothic_People_Ent3_hapsby = I guess I\u2019ve got to do what Dr. Luveno says. Go on through.
Gothic_House_Luveno = Greetings. What took you so long? Let's get started. First, go fetch my assistant. He\u2019s probably hiding inside the underground passageway. A bit paranoid, that one.
Gothic_House_Luveno_pos_Assistant = Right. It looks like my staff is assembled. What, you don't think two people can build a spaceship? I'll have you know I've been building these since you were in diapers! Now then, buying a spaceship isn't like buying some Peloriemate. This is a serious investment, and it will cost you serious money. I require 1200 mesetas upfront. Can you cover that?
Gothic_House_Luveno_fee_No = If you don\u2019t do as I say, there\u2019s no way I can help you.
Gothic_House_Luveno_fee_Yes = Splendid. We'll begin construction immediately. This is going to require some time, I'm a bit rusty. Why don't you go slay some Slimes, or whatever it is you people do?
Gothic_House_Luveno_fee_NotEnough = You don\u2019t have enough? Go get some more!
Gothic_House_Luveno_work1 = Please, you can't rush perfection.
Gothic_House_Luveno_work2 = Unless you want to end up stranded in space, give us time.
Gothic_House_Luveno_work3 = Can't you go wander around a cave or something? We're very busy.
Gothic_House_Luveno_ready = Success! This is my finest work yet. I call it the Luveno. Got a nice ring to it, don't you think? But I'm afraid the Luveno can\u2019t be piloted by a human...
Gothic_House_Luveno_before_hapsby = I built a robot named Hapsby years ago, he's a good pilot. He's probably still in that scrap heap in Bortevo. Go fetch him, will you? Careful though, Bortevo's surrounded by lava. Don't give me that look! You agreed to follow my instructions. I've upheld my end of the bargain, now go do yours.
Gothic_House_Luveno_with_hapsby = Ah, my little Hapsby, you've come home! Excellent. With Hapsby you can pilot the Luveno through space! And just in time, too. Spaceport security has gotten tighter. Go on! The Luveno is docked just outside the village! Go try it out!
Gothic_House_Luveno_after_hapsby = How\u2019s the Luveno holding up? Take good care of it.

# Triada (Prison)
Triada_Robot = Do you have a Road Pass?
Triada_RobotYes = You may proceed.
Triada_RobotNo = Intruder detected. Initiating termination sequence.
Triada_Man_1 = I could really use a PelorieMate. Can you spare one?
Triada_Man_1No = Then I ain't helping. Get lost.
Triada_Man_1Yes = Thanks. Y'know, no matter what people say, spiders are actually very wise creatures.
Triada_Man_2 = The tower in the mountains of Gothic is called Medusa\u2019s Tower.
Triada_Spider = A chemical called Polymeteral will dissolve any material! ...well, anything except Laconia, of course.
Triada_Man_3 = It has been so long since I've seen another person. Won't you stay for a while and talk to me?
Triada_Man_3No = Oh, nevermind.
Triada_Man_3Yes = I've got a friend in Bortevo. I guess things are pretty bad there right now, what with those pools of lava and all. If you see him, could you say 'hi' to him for me?
Triada_Man_4 = Have you heard of Hapsby the robot?
Triada_Man_4Yes = Oh, nevermind.
Triada_Man_4No = It's a robot made of laconia. But it has been abandoned somewhere as being useless.
Triada_Man_5 = The other side of the mountain's completely covered in lava. Damned volcanoes put me out of a home!
Triada_Luveno_1 = Yes, I'm Dr. Luveno. If you're here to rescue me, forget it! I'm not going anywhere.
Triada_Luveno_2 = What? Build a spaceship?! Are you loony? Please, I'm an old man. Leave me be.
Triada_Luveno_3 = You're not going to leave, are you? Very well. I'll help you out, but you must do exactly as I say. Understood?
Triada_Luveno_3Yes = Fine. Meet me in Gothic, I'll prepare you a ship. Don\u2019t worry about me, I'm tougher than I look.
Triada_Luveno_3No = If you don't obey me, I cannot help.

# Bortevo
Bortevo_People_Man_1 = Someone told me that there\u2019s a perfectly good robot discarded in one of these scrap heaps. I wonder if it\u2019s true?
Bortevo_People_Man_2 = This is MY turf! And this house? MY house! And those big piles of junk? That's right. MY junk. MINE. All of it. Don't touch my junk! I'm watching you.
Bortevo_People_Cave = I've heard that they sell a chemical called Polymeteral in Avion Village.
Bortevo_House_Hapsby = Alisa takes out Polymetral. The bottlecap opens and the contents quietly leak out.
Bortevo_Hapsby_Free = It\u2019s a robot made of Laconia! Luveno created Hapsby as a prototype spaceship pilot. It was abandoned in a scrap heap and left to rot. What a waste...
Bortevo_Hapsby = Greetings. I am pilot robot Hapsby. I will assist you in the operation of any Luveno brand spacecraft.
Bortevo_House_Hovercraft = You found a FlowMover. Hapsby fixed the parts that were broken, so you can use it now!

# Loar
Loar_People_Man = This is Lore Village. Well, it used to be, before LaShiec stepped into office. Now it's just a wasteland for the starving.
Loar_House_1 = Have you heard about Laerma trees?

Loar_House_1No = I hear the Altiplano plateau on Dezoris is totally covered with 'em.

Loar_House_3 = Have you heard of a jewel called the Carbunckle Eye? It\u2019s rumored to be held by a dragon in Casba. What does a dragon need a jewel for anyway?
Loar_House_4 = It's about time someone went after that brute. Good luck. LaShiec's no pushover. His black magic could destroy you. I've heard certain crystals can protect you against such magic. It's just a rumor, though. Don't quote me on that.

# Abion
Abion_House_1 = A really strange man recently moved here. Quiet guy. Rumor has it he's experimenting on animals. And that strange pot! He's always walking around with it clutched to his chest. First the lava cuts us off from society, then this guy moves in. What's this town coming to?
Abion_House_2 = Our new neighbor sure knows a lot about animals. He told me the weirdest thing about Musk Cats. He says if they eat a certain berry, they grow huge, and can fly! I told him he was nuts, of course. What kind of berry? Hm. Sorry, I can't recall.
Abion_People_Ent1 = This village is called Avion.
Abion_People_Ent2 = I\u2019d like to travel through space someday.

Uzo_House_1No = Well, this is a secret, but I went and buried one on the outskirts of Gothic village. Don\u2019t tell anybody I told you that!
Uzo_House_2 = Have you heard of a cloak called the Frad Mantle? From what I hear, it\u2019s really light, yet has excellent protective power.
Uzo_House_3 = To the South of Uzo lies a village called Casba.
Uzo_House_4 = This is Uzo Village, on Motavia.

Casba_House_1 = Do you know what a FlowMover is?
Casba_House_1No = Oh, they're marvelous! When they work, of course. They can glide smoothly across the top of the water.
Casba_House_1Yes = So you know what junk they are! I bought one in Shion city, on Palma. It broke down, so I dumped it in Bartevo. What a waste!
Casba_House_2 = They speak of some sort of legendary shield. Apparently, Perseus once used it to confront a monster.
Casba_House_3 = There's a terrible poison mist west of here. I don't think you can get through it without protection.

Drasgow_People_Ent2 = I hear that there's an enchanted sword in Lost Island Tower.
Drasgow_People_Ent3 = Wow! I didn't expect to see visitors here anytime soon. Not since LaShiec put an embargo on sea travel, anyway. How the heck did you get here?
Drasgow_People_Dungeon_Man = Do you know what a GasClear is? They protect you from poison gas. A shop near here sells them, but I can't find it! Maybe if I head left, up ahead...
Drasgow_People_Dungeon_FalseShop = This is an item shop. What can I do for you? ...actually, I lied. This isn't an item shop at all. What? Don't look at me like that.
Drasgow_People_Dungeon_Shop = I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re surprised to find a shop in a place like this, huh? GasClears are 1000 mesetas each. Pretty cheap, no? Want one?
Drasgow_People_Dungeon_ShopNo = Suit yourself. I'll be here when you change your mind.
Drasgow_People_Dungeon_ShopYes = Thanks. Come again!

# Sopia

Sopia_House_2 = Before LaShiec's powerful grasp, even this village was very wealthy.
Sopia_House_3 = I am the head of this village. We in Sopia are very poor. We're outcasts. The mist shuts us off from other towns. Might you donate 400 mesetas to us?
Sopia_House_3No = I see. I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Ohhh...
Sopia_House_3NotEnough = So you are poor as well, are you? Such sad times these are.
Sopia_House_3Yes = Thank you. Perhaps I can help you, in return. I imagine you're looking for Perseus' shield. According to a local legend, Perseus used it to slay Medusa. It's rumored to be on an island in the lake. I've heard that it's buried under a cactus. I'm sorry, that's all I know. Good luck.
Sopia_House_4 = Hi, I'm Gamer Miki! Do you own a Master System?

Sopia_House_7 = I heard that Palma is a beautiful planet. Is it true?
Sopia_House_7Yes = Anywhere's better than a town surrounded by poison mist.
Sopia_House_7No = Oh, I see. I want to go to a place with cleaner air.


# Tajim's Cave
Tajim_Intro = Ah, Lutz, my pupil! You plan to overthrow LaShiec, eh? Then you must pass one final test. Let's duel.
Tajim_Defeat = You need more training, my boy. Come back when you're ready. I'll be waiting.
Tajim_Victory = You have grown strong, Lutz. I can't teach you any more. Take this. It's a Frad Cloak. It will protect your body from harm. Now go, my boy.
Tajim_Return = I have nothing left to teach you, my boy.
Tajim_WithoutLutz = And who might you people be? My pupil, Lutz, is in Mahal Cave. Do you know him?

Skure_House_6 = Whatever nonsense LaShiec's gotten involved with has gone too far. I've heard dead bodies in Guaran Morgue have come back to life! Please, stop him. This is horrible!
Skure_House_7 = Laconia is more than just strong, it's sacred. LaShiec knows this, of course. That's why laconian equipment is so hard to find! He's afraid of it!
Skure_People_Ent1 = Welcome to Skray! Stick around, it's warm down here.
Skure_People_Ent2 = Almost all of the immigrants from Palma live in this town.

# Aukba (Dezorian Town)

Aukba_Left_House_2 = You might want to check out the Corona Tower. On the other side of the mountains to the north, it is. We have friends there, we do. Give them our regards, you will?
Aukba_Left_House_3 = To the west of Corona Tower lies Dezoris Cave, it does.
Aukba_Left_House_4 = Laerma trees bear strange fruits. They're called Laerma Berries, they are. They're tasty. I want to eat them, I do. The problem is, we have to put them in a Laconian jar. If we don't, they get all dried up, they do.
Aukba_Left_House_5 = Heard of something called an Aeroprism, have you?
Aukba_Left_House_5Yes = I\u2019d really like to look into one sometime, I would.

Gate_Baya_Malay_Prisoner = Oh, so you are confined in here as well. How sad. Sure, there's a way out of here. But what's the point? Life is so much less complicated here.
